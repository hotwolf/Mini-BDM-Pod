<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/BDMPgmr-Bootloader.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://cache.nxp.com/files/soft_dev_tools/software/programmers/D-Bug12XZv6FW.zip">D-Bug12XZ Firmware</a> needs a bootloader(BDMPgmr bootloader) to run. This piece of firmware is included in <a href="http://www.nxp.com">Frescale&#8217;s</a>  <a href="http://nxp.com/files/soft_dev_tools/software/programmers/LFBDMPGMRFW.zip"><span class="caps">LFBDMPGMRFW</span> software package</a>. This software is provided as a windows installer, which must be run. Afterwards the bootloader is located in a directory named &#8220;Firmware&#8221; within the installation directory (i.e C:\Program Files\Freescale\BDMProgrammer\Firmware\S12XEBoot.S19).</p>
<p>The Bootloader is the only firmware code, which must be programmed into the Mini-<span class="caps">BDM</span>-Pod via the &#8220;<span class="caps">BDM</span> IN&#8221; interface. The initial loading and updationg of the <a href="http://cache.nxp.com/files/soft_dev_tools/software/programmers/D-Bug12XZv6FW.zip">D-Bug12XZ Firmware</a> itself can be done with the help of the bootloader via the <span class="caps">USB</span> interface.</p>
<p>To invoke the bootloader menu, the &#8220;bootloader&#8221;-jumper must be closed when the Mini-<span class="caps">BDM</span>-Pod is powered up.</p>
